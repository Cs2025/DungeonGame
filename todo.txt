To do:

add a third option for burning the monster if you grabbed a torch (for the option, add a *Special* text,
showing that the option is only available because you have a special item from earlier in the game

add a feature where if you kill the monster with the torch, it is removed from inv

add a treasure you can pick up and bring to the end of the game for flavor text if you go right
(not in the treasure box early on, implement this feature later where if you go right with the torch,
avoiding the monster, and bring the torch to late-game, you can burn down a wall or something, revealing
the special treasure)

? Add ASCII art for when you pick up the torch, etc.
