To do:

add a treasure you can pick up and bring to the end of the game for flavor text if you go right
(not in the treasure box early on, implement this feature later where if you go the right way with the torch,
avoiding the monster, and bring the torch to late-game, you can burn down a wall or something, revealing
the special treasure)

make the merchant on floor 1 say your name
